_Loan Risk Analysis Using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Identifying Defaulters and Reducing Financial Risk in Lending_

**Introduction**

This project demonstrates the application of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) in a real-world business scenario involving risk analytics
in the banking and financial services sector. By working through this project, you will not only apply EDA techniques but also gain an
understanding of how data-driven analysis can help minimize financial risk when lending to customers.

**Problem Statement**
Loan-providing institutions face significant challenges when approving loans for individuals with insufficient or non-existent credit histories. 
Some consumers exploit this situation, resulting in defaults on their loans.

When a company receives a loan application, it must decide whether to approve or reject the loan based on the applicantâ€™s profile. 
Two main risks are associated with this decision:

**Business Loss:** If an applicant is capable of repaying the loan but their application is denied, the company loses potential business.

**Financial Loss:** If an applicant is likely to default on the loan but their application is approved, the company may suffer financial losses.

**Business Objectives**
The primary objective of this case study is to identify patterns that indicate whether a client is likely to have difficulty in paying their loan installments.
These insights can be used to take appropriate actions, such as:

Denying the loan application.
Reducing the loan amount.
Lending to high-risk applicants at higher interest rates.

By applying EDA techniques to identify these patterns, the analysis ensures that customers who can repay their loans are not unjustly 
rejected and that risk is managed effectively. The goal is to support lending decisions that balance profitability with minimized financial risk.
